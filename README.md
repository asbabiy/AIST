## Data
Both datasets have been **manually** anonymized because of VK privacy policies. Besides, they were normalized in a bit different way comparing with their initial versions, used in this study.

`msg_with_emoji.csv` is a small dataset (~10k samples), containing annotated messages with emoji.

`train_data.csv` is a relatively large dataset (~54k samples; only half of the dataset is uploaded here, full version will be uploaded a bit later).
